What is vaccum optimizer ?," The vacuum optimizer is a feature that helps to optimize the performance of a collection by removing unused or deleted vectors from the index. This is done by setting a threshold for the number of deleted vectors that can trigger the vacuum process. This feature is configurable through the ""vacuum_min_vector_number"" parameter in the optimizer_config section of the collection configuration. For more information, please refer to the 'OptimizersConfig' section of the documentation on collections.

In Qdrant, when records are deleted, they are not immediately removed from the database. Instead, they are marked as deleted and subsequently ignored in future queries. This approach helps minimize disk access but results in accumulated deleted records that can occupy valuable memory and degrade performance over time.
The Vacuum Optimizer addresses this issue by systematically clearing out these marked-as-deleted records once they reach a certain threshold. This threshold is configurable and includes conditions such as the minimum fraction of deleted vectors in a segment and the minimum number of vectors present in a segment. "
Tell me about ‘always_ram’ parameter?," The `always_ram` parameter in the quantization configuration determines whether quantized vectors are kept in RAM or not.

What is difference between scalar and product quantization?," Scalar quantization is a compression technique that reduces the number of bits used to represent each vector component, while product quantization compresses the size of the vector itself. Scalar quantization may result in a slight decrease in search quality due to the loss of accuracy, but this can be negligible for high-dimensional vectors. Product quantization, on the other hand, is not SIMD-friendly and may also result in a loss of accuracy. It is recommended to use product quantization only for high-dimensional vectors. For more information on how to optimize quantization parameters, please refer to the ""Quantization Tips"" section in the documentation (source: documentation/guides/quantization.md).","['document:But there are some tradeoffs. Product quantization distance calculations are not SIMD-friendly, so it is slower than scalar quantization.\n\nAlso, product quantization has a loss of accuracy, so it is recommended to use it only for high-dimensional vectors.\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the [Quantization Tips](#quantization-tips) section for more information on how to optimize the quantization parameters for your use case.\n\n\n\n## How to choose the right quantization method,source:documentation/guides/quantization.md'
 'document:The main drawback of scalar quantization is the loss of accuracy. The `float32 -> uint8` conversion introduces an error that can lead to a slight decrease in search quality.\n\nHowever, this error is usually negligible, and tends to be less significant for high-dimensional vectors.\n\nIn our experiments, we found that the error introduced by scalar quantization is usually less than 1%. \n\n\n\nHowever, this value depends on the data and the quantization parameters.,source:documentation/guides/quantization.md'
 'document:. For example, on one of the previous releases we have scalar quantization and product quantization, which can compress up to 64 times the size of the vector. And we only keep in fast storage these compressed vectors.,source:blog/binary-quantization-andrey-vasnetsov-vector-space-talk-001.md'
 'document:*Available as of v1.1.0*\n\n\n\nScalar quantization, in the context of vector search engines, is a compression technique that compresses vectors by reducing the number of bits used to represent each vector component.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, Qdrant uses 32-bit floating numbers to represent the original vector components. Scalar quantization allows you to reduce the number of bits used to 8.\n\nIn other words, Qdrant performs `float32 -> uint8` conversion for each vector component.,source:documentation/guides/quantization.md']","While both methods aim to reduce the memory footprint and potentially speed up operations, scalar quantization offers faster processing with SIMD-friendly operations and minimal accuracy loss, making it suitable for scenarios where speed is critical. Product quantization achieves higher compression rates and is better suited for handling very high-dimensional vectors where memory space is more of a concern than computation speed."
What is ‘best_score’ strategy?," The ‘best_score’ strategy is a new recommendation strategy introduced in version 1.6 of the Qdrant software. It is based on the idea of finding similar vectors by selecting the ones that are closer to a positive example while avoiding the ones that are closer to a negative one. This strategy takes into account all examples separately, resulting in a richer variety of results compared to the old strategy.","['document:#   [ScoredPoint(id=3, version=0, score=0.09, \n\n#                payload=None, vector=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1]),\n\n#    ScoredPoint(id=1, version=0, score=0.10049876, \n\n#                payload=None, vector=[0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0])]\n\n# ]\n\n\n\n```,source:blog/batch-vector-search-with-qdrant.md'

How does oversampling helps?," Oversampling helps by equalizing the representation of classes in the training dataset, thus enabling more fair and accurate modeling of real-world scenarios. This is explained in the article ""Binary Quantization"" in the section ""Oversampling"" (source: articles/binary-quantization.md). Oversampling is a special technique used to control precision of the search in real time, as mentioned in the blog post ""Binary Quantization and Andrey Vasnetsov's Vector Space Talk"" (source: blog/binary-quantization-andrey-vasnetsov-vector-space-talk-001.md). It allows for retrieving more vectors than needed and assigning more precise scores during rescoring, resulting in better results. However, as mentioned in the article ""Binary Quantization"" (source: articles/binary-quantization.md), oversampling does not always guarantee improvement in results.","['document:oversampling helps equalize the representation of classes in the training dataset, thus enabling more fair and accurate modeling of real-world scenarios.,source:articles/binary-quantization-openai.md'
 'document:These two parameters are how you are going to balance speed versus accuracy. The larger the size of your oversample, the more items you need to read from disk and the more elements you have to search with the relatively slower full vector index. On the other hand, doing this will produce more accurate results.,source:articles/binary-quantization.md'
 'document:Yeah, so oversampling is a special technique we use to control precision of the search in real time, in query time. And the thing is, we can internally retrieve from quantized storage a bit more vectors than we actually need. And when we do rescoring with original vectors, we assign more precise score. And therefore from this overselection, we can pick only those vectors which are actually good for the user,source:blog/binary-quantization-andrey-vasnetsov-vector-space-talk-001.md'
 'document:We see that ""correct"" results i.e. recall increases as the number of potential ""candidates"" increase (limit x oversampling). To highlight the impact of changing the `limit`, different limit values are broken apart into different curves. For example, we see that the lowest recall for limit 50 is around 94 correct, with 100 candidates. This also implies we used an oversampling of 2.0\n\n\n\nAs oversampling increases, we see a general improvement in results – but that does not hold in every case.,source:articles/binary-quantization.md']","Defines how many extra vectors should be pre-selected using quantized index, and then re-scored using original vectors. For example, if oversampling is 2.4 and limit is 100, then 240 vectors will be pre-selected using quantized index, and then top-100 will be returned after re-scoring. Oversampling is useful if you want to tune the tradeoff between search speed and search quality in the query time."
