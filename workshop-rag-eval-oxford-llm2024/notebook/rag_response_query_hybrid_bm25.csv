What is vaccum optimizer ?," The vacuum optimizer is a feature in Qdrant that helps optimize the performance and resource usage of the database. It works by deleting unused or unnecessary vectors and merging small chunks of data into larger ones. This helps improve the speed and efficiency of similarity searches.

What is difference between scalar and product quantization?," Scalar quantization and product quantization are two different methods of compressing vector embeddings.

How does oversampling helps?, Oversampling is a technique used to improve the accuracy and performance of similarity search algorithms. It works by retrieving more vectors than needed from quantized storage and then re-scoring them with the original vectors to assign a more precise score. This helps to limit the loss of information inherent in quantization and preserve the semantic richness of OpenAI embeddings. The oversampling factor of 3 is recommended for the best balance between accuracy and efficiency. This information can be found in the 'Oversampling' section of the 'Binary Quantization' article in the OpenAI documentation.,"['document:### Oversampling for quantization\n\n\n\nWe are introducing [oversampling](/documentation/guides/quantization/#oversampling) as a new way to help you improve the accuracy and performance of similarity search algorithms.

 'document:Yeah, so oversampling is a special technique we use to control precision of the search in real time, in query time. And the thing is, we can internally retrieve from quantized storage a bit more vectors than we actually need. And when we do rescoring with original vectors, we assign more precise score. And therefore from this overselection, we can pick only those vectors which are actually good for the user,source:blog/binary-quantization-andrey-vasnetsov-vector-space-talk-001.md'
 'document:- **Oversampling**: By oversampling, we can limit the loss of information inherent in quantization. This also helps to preserve the semantic richness of your OpenAI embeddings.

For example, if oversampling is 2.4 and limit is 100, then 240 vectors will be pre-selected using quantized index, and then top-100 will be returned after re-scoring.

What is significance of ‘on_disk_payload’ setting?," The 'on_disk_payload' setting allows for the storage of payload data on disk only, which can be useful for limiting RAM usage in case of large payloads.
