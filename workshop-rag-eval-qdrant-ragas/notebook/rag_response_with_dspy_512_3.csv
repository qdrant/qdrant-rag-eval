What is vaccum optimizer ?," The vacuum optimizer is a feature that helps to optimize the performance of the database by removing unused or deleted data from the database. This is done by setting a threshold for the amount of deleted data that can be present in the database before it is removed. This information can be found in the ""optimizer_config"" section of the documentation, specifically under the ""deleted_threshold"" key. For more information, please refer to page 5 of the 'source' field of fetched context from the documentation.","['optimizersConfig: new OptimizersConfigDiff { DefaultSegmentNumber = 2 }\n\n);\n\n```'

In Qdrant, when records are deleted, they are not immediately removed from the database. Instead, they are marked as deleted and subsequently ignored in future queries. This approach helps minimize disk access but results in accumulated deleted records that can occupy valuable memory and degrade performance over time.
The Vacuum Optimizer addresses this issue by systematically clearing out these marked-as-deleted records once they reach a certain threshold. This threshold is configurable and includes conditions such as the minimum fraction of deleted vectors in a segment and the minimum number of vectors present in a segment. "
Tell me about ‘always_ram’ parameter?," The `always_ram` parameter is used to determine whether quantized vectors should be kept cached in RAM or not. By default, quantized vectors are loaded in the same way as the original vectors. However, in some setups, it may be beneficial to keep quantized vectors in RAM to speed up the search process.

What is difference between scalar and product quantization?," Scalar quantization is a method of compressing data by converting floating-point numbers to integers, which can lead to a slight decrease in search quality due to the loss of accuracy. On the other hand, product quantization is a more efficient method of compression that can compress data up to 64 times the original size, but it also has a loss of accuracy. It is recommended to use product quantization for high-dimensional vectors, as the error introduced is usually negligible. For more information on how to optimize quantization parameters, please refer to the 'Quantization Tips' section of the documentation.","['But there are some tradeoffs. Product quantization distance calculations are not SIMD-friendly, so it is slower than scalar quantization.\n\nAlso, product quantization has a loss of accuracy, so it is recommended to use it only for high-dimensional vectors.\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the [Quantization Tips](#quantization-tips) section for more information on how to optimize the quantization parameters for your use case.\n\n\n\n## How to choose the right quantization method'
 'The main drawback of scalar quantization is the loss of accuracy. The `float32 -> uint8` conversion introduces an error that can lead to a slight decrease in search quality.\n\nHowever, this error is usually negligible, and tends to be less significant for high-dimensional vectors.\n\nIn our experiments, we found that the error introduced by scalar quantization is usually less than 1%. \n\n\n\nHowever, this value depends on the data and the quantization parameters.'
 '. For example, on one of the previous releases we have scalar quantization and product quantization, which can compress up to 64 times the size of the vector. And we only keep in fast storage these compressed vectors.']","While both methods aim to reduce the memory footprint and potentially speed up operations, scalar quantization offers faster processing with SIMD-friendly operations and minimal accuracy loss, making it suitable for scenarios where speed is critical. Product quantization achieves higher compression rates and is better suited for handling very high-dimensional vectors where memory space is more of a concern than computation speed."
What is ‘best_score’ strategy?," The ‘best_score’ strategy is a new strategy introduced in v1.6. It is based on the idea that the best way to find similar vectors is to find the ones that are closer to a positive example, while avoiding the ones that are closer to a negative one. This strategy is set implicitly, but can also be explicitly defined by setting ""strategy"": ""best_score"" in the recommendation request. It is linearly impacted by the amount of examples and is considered the default strategy.","['#   [ScoredPoint(id=3, version=0, score=0.09, \n\n#                payload=None, vector=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1]),\n\n#    ScoredPoint(id=1, version=0, score=0.10049876, \n\n#                payload=None, vector=[0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0])]\n\n# ]\n\n\n\n```'

This strategy measures each candidate against every example and selects the best positive and best negative scores. The final score is determined using a specific formula: if the best positive score is greater than the best negative score, the final score is set as the best positive score. Otherwise, the final score is calculated as the negative of the square of the best negative score. It is important to note that the performance of the `best_score` strategy is linearly impacted by the number of examples provided."
How does oversampling helps?," Oversampling is a technique used to balance the representation of classes in the training dataset, which leads to more fair and accurate modeling of real-world scenarios. This is achieved by retrieving more vectors than needed from quantized storage and assigning more precise scores during rescoring, resulting in the selection of only the most relevant vectors for the user. This information can be found in the documentation under the ""Oversampling"" section on page 5.","['oversampling helps equalize the representation of classes in the training dataset, thus enabling more fair and accurate modeling of real-world scenarios.'
 'These two parameters are how you are going to balance speed versus accuracy. The larger the size of your oversample, the more items you need to read from disk and the more elements you have to search with the relatively slower full vector index. On the other hand, doing this will produce more accurate results.'
 'Yeah, so oversampling is a special technique we use to control precision of the search in real time, in query time. And the thing is, we can internally retrieve from quantized storage a bit more vectors than we actually need. And when we do rescoring with original vectors, we assign more precise score. And therefore from this overselection, we can pick only those vectors which are actually good for the user']","Defines how many extra vectors should be pre-selected using quantized index, and then re-scored using original vectors. For example, if oversampling is 2.4 and limit is 100, then 240 vectors will be pre-selected using quantized index, and then top-100 will be returned after re-scoring. Oversampling is useful if you want to tune the tradeoff between search speed and search quality in the query time."
