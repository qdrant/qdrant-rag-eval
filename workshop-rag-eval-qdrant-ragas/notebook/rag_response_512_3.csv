What is vaccum optimizer ?," The vacuum optimizer is a feature that helps to optimize the performance of a collection by removing deleted documents and reclaiming disk space. This is done by setting a threshold for the number of deleted documents that can trigger the optimization process.

In Qdrant, when records are deleted, they are not immediately removed from the database. Instead, they are marked as deleted and subsequently ignored in future queries. This approach helps minimize disk access but results in accumulated deleted records that can occupy valuable memory and degrade performance over time.
The Vacuum Optimizer addresses this issue by systematically clearing out these marked-as-deleted records once they reach a certain threshold. This threshold is configurable and includes conditions such as the minimum fraction of deleted vectors in a segment and the minimum number of vectors present in a segment. "
Tell me about ‘always_ram’ parameter?," The `always_ram` parameter determines whether quantized vectors are kept in RAM or not. By default, quantized vectors are loaded in the same way as the original vectors. However, in some setups, it may be beneficial to keep quantized vectors in RAM to speed up the search process.

What is difference between scalar and product quantization?," The main difference between scalar and product quantization is the way they compress vectors. Scalar quantization converts float32 values to uint8, which can lead to a slight decrease in search quality due to the loss of accuracy. On the other hand, product quantization compresses vectors by dividing them into smaller subvectors and quantizing each subvector separately. This method is slower than scalar quantization and also has a loss of accuracy, but it is recommended for high-dimensional vectors. For more information on how to optimize the quantization parameters for your specific use case, please refer to the ""Quantization Tips"" section in the documentation/guides/quantization.md file.","['document:But there are some tradeoffs. Product quantization distance calculations are not SIMD-friendly, so it is slower than scalar quantization.\n\nAlso, product quantization has a loss of accuracy, so it is recommended to use it only for high-dimensional vectors.\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the [Quantization Tips](#quantization-tips) section for more information on how to optimize the quantization parameters for your use case.\n\n\n\n## How to choose the right quantization method,source:documentation/guides/quantization.md'
 'document:The main drawback of scalar quantization is the loss of accuracy. The `float32 -> uint8` conversion introduces an error that can lead to a slight decrease in search quality.\n\nHowever, this error is usually negligible, and tends to be less significant for high-dimensional vectors.\n\nIn our experiments, we found that the error introduced by scalar quantization is usually less than 1%. \n\n\n\nHowever, this value depends on the data and the quantization parameters.,source:documentation/guides/quantization.md'
 'document:. For example, on one of the previous releases we have scalar quantization and product quantization, which can compress up to 64 times the size of the vector. And we only keep in fast storage these compressed vectors.,source:blog/binary-quantization-andrey-vasnetsov-vector-space-talk-001.md']","While both methods aim to reduce the memory footprint and potentially speed up operations, scalar quantization offers faster processing with SIMD-friendly operations and minimal accuracy loss, making it suitable for scenarios where speed is critical. Product quantization achieves higher compression rates and is better suited for handling very high-dimensional vectors where memory space is more of a concern than computation speed."
What is ‘best_score’ strategy?," The 'best_score' strategy is a new approach introduced in version 1.6 of the Qdrant software. It is based on the idea that the best way to find similar vectors is to identify those that are closer to a positive example while avoiding those that are closer to a negative one. This strategy can be explicitly defined in a recommendation request by setting ""strategy"": ""best_score"". More information on this strategy can be found in the documentation under the 'Explore' section.","['document:#   [ScoredPoint(id=3, version=0, score=0.09, \n\n#                payload=None, vector=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1]),\n\n#    ScoredPoint(id=1, version=0, score=0.10049876, \n\n#                payload=None, vector=[0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0])]\n\n# ]\n\n\n\n```,source:blog/batch-vector-search-with-qdrant.md'

How does oversampling helps?," Oversampling helps by equalizing the representation of classes in the training dataset, thus enabling more fair and accurate modeling of real-world scenarios. This is explained in the article ""Binary Quantization OpenAI"" in the section on oversampling. Additionally, oversampling can also improve the precision of search in real time, as described in the blog post ""Binary Quantization Andrey Vasnetsov Vector Space Talk 001"" in the section on oversampling.","['document:oversampling helps equalize the representation of classes in the training dataset, thus enabling more fair and accurate modeling of real-world scenarios.,source:articles/binary-quantization-openai.md'
 'document:These two parameters are how you are going to balance speed versus accuracy. The larger the size of your oversample, the more items you need to read from disk and the more elements you have to search with the relatively slower full vector index. On the other hand, doing this will produce more accurate results.,source:articles/binary-quantization.md'
 'document:Yeah, so oversampling is a special technique we use to control precision of the search in real time, in query time. And the thing is, we can internally retrieve from quantized storage a bit more vectors than we actually need. And when we do rescoring with original vectors, we assign more precise score. And therefore from this overselection, we can pick only those vectors which are actually good for the user,source:blog/binary-quantization-andrey-vasnetsov-vector-space-talk-001.md']","Defines how many extra vectors should be pre-selected using quantized index, and then re-scored using original vectors. For example, if oversampling is 2.4 and limit is 100, then 240 vectors will be pre-selected using quantized index, and then top-100 will be returned after re-scoring. Oversampling is useful if you want to tune the tradeoff between search speed and search quality in the query time."

By increasing this value, the write operations become more tolerant to network partitions within the cluster. However, this also means that a higher number of replicas need to be active in order to perform write operations successfully."
