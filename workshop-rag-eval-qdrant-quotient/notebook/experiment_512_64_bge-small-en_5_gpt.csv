What is vaccum optimizer ?,"The Vacuum Optimizer is a feature in the Qdrant database designed to manage and improve system performance by removing obsolete data. In Qdrant, when records are deleted, they are not immediately removed from the database. Instead, they are marked as deleted and subsequently ignored in future queries. This approach helps minimize disk access but results in accumulated deleted records that can occupy valuable memory and degrade performance over time.
The Vacuum Optimizer addresses this issue by systematically clearing out these marked-as-deleted records once they reach a certain threshold. This threshold is configurable and includes conditions such as the minimum fraction of deleted vectors in a segment and the minimum number of vectors present in a segment.

## How to choose the right quantization method
The main drawback of scalar quantization is the loss of accuracy. The `float32 -> uint8` conversion introduces an error that can lead to a slight decrease in search quality.

However, this error is usually negligible, and tends to be less significant for high-dimensional vectors.

In our experiments, we found that the error introduced by scalar quantization is usually less than 1%. 



However, this value depends on the data and the quantization parameters.
. For example, on one of the previous releases we have scalar quantization and product quantization, which can compress up to 64 times the size of the vector. And we only keep in fast storage these compressed vectors.
## Scalar Quantization



*Available as of v1.1.0*



Scalar quantization, in the context of vector search engines, is a compression technique that compresses vectors by reducing the number of bits used to represent each vector component.





For instance, Qdrant uses 32-bit floating numbers to represent the original vector components. Scalar quantization allows you to reduce the number of bits used to 8.

In other words, Qdrant performs `float32 -> uint8` conversion for each vector component.
- Deployment in a low-RAM environment where the limiting factor is the number of disk reads rather than the vector comparison itself

- Situations where the dimensionality of the original vectors is sufficiently high

- Cases where indexing speed is not a critical factor



In circumstances that do not align with the above, Scalar Quantization should be the preferred choice.

How does oversampling helps?,"Defines how many extra vectors should be pre-selected using quantized index, and then re-scored using original vectors.

This method requires a Qdrant instance and a payload index name as input parameters.,"['const client = new QdrantClient({ host: ""localhost"", port: 6333 });\n\n\n\nclient.createPayloadIndex(""{collection_name}"", {\n\n  field_name: ""name_of_the_field_to_index"",\n\n  field_schema: {\n\n    type: ""text"",\n\n    tokenizer: ""word"",\n\n    min_token_len: 2,\n\n    max_token_len: 15,\n\n    lowercase: true,\n\n  },\n\n});\n\n```\n\n\n\n```rust\n\nuse qdrant_client::{\n\n    client::QdrantClient,\n\n    qdrant::{\n\n        payload_index_params::IndexParams, FieldType, PayloadIndexParams, TextIndexParams,\n\n        TokenizerType,', '.setMaxTokenLen(10)\n\n                    .setLowercase(true)\n\n                    .build())\n\n            .build(),\n\n        null,\n\n        null,\n\n        null)\n\n    .get();\n\n```\n\n\n\n```csharp\n\nusing Qdrant.Client;\n\nusing Qdrant.Client.Grpc;\n\n\n\nvar client = new QdrantClient(""localhost"", 6334);\n\n\n\nawait client.CreatePayloadIndexAsync(\n\n\tcollectionName: ""{collection_name}"",\n\n\tfieldName: ""name_of_the_field_to_index"",\n\n\tschemaType: PayloadSchemaType.Text,', 'client\n\n    .createPayloadIndexAsync(\n\n        ""{collection_name}"",\n\n        ""name_of_the_field_to_index"",\n\n        PayloadSchemaType.Keyword,\n\n        null,\n\n        null,\n\n        null,\n\n        null)\n\n    .get();\n\n```\n\n\n\n```csharp\n\nusing Qdrant.Client;\n\n\n\nvar client = new QdrantClient(""localhost"", 6334);\n\n\n\nawait client.CreatePayloadIndexAsync(collectionName: ""{collection_name}"", fieldName: ""name_of_the_field_to_index"");\n\n```\n\n\n\nAvailable field types are:', 'FieldType::Keyword,\n\n        None,\n\n        None,\n\n    )\n\n    .await?;\n\n```\n\n\n\n```java\n\nimport io.qdrant.client.QdrantClient;\n\nimport io.qdrant.client.QdrantGrpcClient;\n\nimport io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.PayloadSchemaType;\n\n\n\nQdrantClient client =\n\n    new QdrantClient(QdrantGrpcClient.newBuilder(""localhost"", 6334, false).build());\n\n\n\nclient\n\n    .createPayloadIndexAsync(\n\n        ""{collection_name}"", ""group_id"", PayloadSchsemaType.Keyword, null, null, null, null)\n\n    .get();\n\n```', 'client\n\n    .create_field_index(\n\n        ""{collection_name}"",\n\n        ""name_of_the_field_to_index"",\n\n        FieldType::Keyword,\n\n        None,\n\n        None,\n\n    )\n\n    .await?;\n\n```\n\n\n\n```java\n\nimport io.qdrant.client.QdrantClient;\n\nimport io.qdrant.client.QdrantGrpcClient;\n\nimport io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.PayloadSchemaType;\n\n\n\nQdrantClient client =\n\n    new QdrantClient(QdrantGrpcClient.newBuilder(""localhost"", 6334, false).build());\n\n\n\nclient\n\n    .createPayloadIndexAsync(']","const client = new QdrantClient({ host: ""localhost"", port: 6333 });

What is significance of ‘on_disk_payload’ setting?,"The `on_disk_payload` setting in the storage configuration determines whether a point's payload will be stored in memory or read from disk every time it is requested.

### Oversampling and Rescoring



A distinctive feature of the Qdrant architecture is the ability to combine the search for quantized and original vectors in a single query.

This enables the best combination of speed, accuracy, and RAM usage.



Qdrant stores the original vectors, so it is possible to rescore the top-k results with

the original vectors after doing the neighbours search in quantized space. That obviously
For example, if `oversampling=2.0` and the `limit=100`, then 200 vectors will first be selected using a quantized index. For those 200 vectors, the full 32 bit vector will be used with their HNSW index to a much more accurate 100 item result set. As opposed to doing a full HNSW search, we oversample a preliminary search and then only do the full search on this much smaller set of vectors.



## Improved Storage Efficiency
#### Set the oversampling factor via query:



Here is how you can configure the oversampling factor - define how many extra vectors should be pre-selected using the quantized index, and then re-scored using original vectors.

# Langchain Go



[Langchain Go](https://tmc.github.io/langchaingo/docs/) is a framework for developing data-aware applications powered by language models in Go.



You can use Qdrant as a vector store in Langchain Go.



## Setup



Install the `langchain-go` project dependency



```bash

go get -u github.com/tmc/langchaingo

```

## Project Overview



Qdrant is a powerful vector search engine widely used for similarity search and clustering. However, it lacked a user-friendly web-based UI for data visualization and exploration. My project aimed to bridge this gap by developing a web-based user interface that allows users to easily interact with and explore their vector data.



## Milestones and Achievements
All of those engines might be easily used in combination with the vector search offered by Qdrant. But the 

exact way how to combine the results of both algorithms to achieve the best search precision might be still 

unclear. So we need to understand how to do it effectively. We will be using reference datasets to benchmark 

the search quality.

In Qdrant, each collection is split into shards. Each shard has a separate Write-Ahead-Log (WAL), which is responsible for ordering operations.

By creating multiple shards, you can parallelize upload of a large dataset. From 2 to 4 shards per one machine is a reasonable number.



```http

PUT /collections/{collection_name}

{

    ""vectors"": {

      ""size"": 768,

      ""distance"": ""Cosine""

    },

    ""shard_number"": 2

}

```



```python
We recommend using our [Rust client library](https://github.com/qdrant/rust-client) for this purpose, as it is the fastest client library available for Qdrant.



If you are not using Rust, you might want to consider parallelizing your upload process.



## Disable indexing during upload



In case you are doing an initial upload of a large dataset, you might want to disable indexing during upload.

It will enable to avoid unnecessary indexing of vectors, which will be overwritten by the next batch.
```http

PUT /collections/{collection_name}

{

    ""vectors"": {

      ""size"": 768,

      ""distance"": ""Cosine""

    },

    ""optimizers_config"": {

        ""memmap_threshold"": 20000

    },

    ""quantization_config"": {

        ""scalar"": {

            ""type"": ""int8"",

            ""always_ram"": true

    }

}

```



```python

from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

from qdrant_client.http import models



client = QdrantClient(""localhost"", port=6333)



client.create_collection(
collection_name=""startups"",

    documents=documents,

    metadata=metadata,

    parallel=0,  # Use all available CPU cores to encode data

)

```



The `add` method will encode all documents and upload them to Qdrant.

This is one of two fastembed-specific methods, that combines encoding and uploading into a single step.



The `parallel` parameter controls the number of CPU cores used to encode data.

The power of vector similarity, in the context of being able to compare any two points, allows making a diverse selection of the collection possible without any labeling efforts.

By maximizing the distance between all points in the response, we can have an algorithm that will sequentially output dissimilar results.
Let's imagine how to get 3 points with similarity search and then with diversity search.



Similarity:

1. Calculate distance matrix

2. Choose your anchor

3. Get a vector corresponding to the distances from the selected anchor from the distance matrix

4. Sort fetched vector

5. Get top-3 embeddings

 

Diversity:

1. Calculate distance matrix

2. Initialize starting point (randomly or according to the certain conditions)
{{< figure src=/articles_data/vector-similarity-beyond-search/diversity.png caption=""Diversity Search"" >}}





Some forms of diversity sampling are already used in the industry and are known as [Maximum Margin Relevance](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/qdrant#maximum-marginal-relevance-search-mmr) (MMR). Techniques like this were developed to enhance similarity on a universal search API.

However, there is still room for new ideas, particularly regarding diversity retrieval.
Then we can search for the most dissimilar points to this reference set and use them as candidates for further analysis.





## Diversity Search



Even with no input provided vector, (dis-)similarity can improve an overall selection of items from the dataset.



The naive approach is to do random sampling. 

However, unless our dataset has a uniform distribution, the results of such sampling might be biased toward more frequent types of items.
{{< figure  width=80% src=/articles_data/vector-similarity-beyond-search/diversity-random.png caption=""Example of random sampling"" >}}





The similarity information can increase the diversity of those results and make the first overview more interesting.

That is especially useful when users do not yet know what they are looking for and want to explore the dataset."
How can you ensure that collection shards are replicated in Qdrant after adding a new node to the cluster?,"To ensure that collection shards are replicated in Qdrant after adding a new node to the cluster, you can use the Replicate Shard Operation.

Shards are evenly distributed across all existing nodes when a collection is first created, but Qdrant does not automatically rebalance shards if your cluster size or replication factor changes (since this is an expensive operation on large clusters). See the next section for how to move shards after scaling operations.



### Moving shards



*Available as of v0.9.0*
Each node knows where all parts of the collection are stored through the [consensus protocol](./#raft), so when you send a search request to one Qdrant node, it automatically queries all other nodes to obtain the full search result.



When you create a collection, Qdrant splits the collection into `shard_number` shards. If left unset, `shard_number` is set to the number of nodes in your cluster:



```http

PUT /collections/{collection_name}

{

    ""vectors"": {

      ""size"": 300,
Practically, it means that if the cluster is in a transition state - either electing a new leader after a failure or starting up, the collection update operations will be denied.



You may use the cluster [REST API](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html?v=master#tag/cluster) to check the state of the consensus.



## Sharding



A Collection in Qdrant is made of one or more shards.

A shard is an independent store of points which is able to perform all operations provided by collections.
Currently, the replication factor of a collection can only be configured at creation time.



```http

PUT /collections/{collection_name}

{

    ""vectors"": {

        ""size"": 300,

        ""distance"": ""Cosine""

    },

    ""shard_number"": 6,

    ""replication_factor"": 2,

}

```

Why?
Those priorities lead to different architectural decisions that are not reproducible in a general-purpose database, even if it has vector index support.

Qdrant even more reliable.

are both possible.



## Upload points



To optimize performance, Qdrant supports batch loading of points. I.e., you can load several points into the service in one API call.

Batching allows you to minimize the overhead of creating a network connection.



The Qdrant API supports two ways of creating batches - record-oriented and column-oriented.

Internally, these options do not differ and are made only for the convenience of interaction.



Create points with batch:



```http
from qdrant_client.http.models import Batch



cohere_client = cohere.Client(""<< your_api_key >>"")

qdrant_client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient()

qdrant_client.upsert(

    collection_name=""MyCollection"",

    points=Batch(

        ids=[1],

        vectors=cohere_client.embed(

            model=""large"",

            texts=[""The best vector database""],

        ).embeddings,

    ),

)

```
batch by batch, into Qdrant:



```python

batch_size = 100



for batch in batched(dataset, batch_size):

    ids = [point.pop(""id"") for point in batch]

    vectors = [point.pop(""vector"") for point in batch]



    client.upsert(

        collection_name=""arxiv-titles-instructorxl-embeddings"",

        points=models.Batch(

            ids=ids,

            vectors=vectors,

            payloads=batch,

        ),

    )

```
Now, thanks to the new batch search, you don’t need to worry about that. Qdrant will handle multiple search requests in just one API call and will perform those requests in the most optimal way.



## An example of using the batch search



We’ve used the official Python client to show how the batch search might be integrated with your application. Since there have been some changes in the interfaces of Qdrant 0.10.0, we’ll go step by step.



## Creating the collection
to create in a second:



```python

from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models



client = QdrantClient(""http://localhost:6333"")



client.create_collection(

    collection_name=""arxiv-titles-instructorxl-embeddings"",

    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(

        size=768,

        distance=models.Distance.COSINE,

    ),

)

```



It is always a good idea to use batching, while loading a large dataset, so let's do that.

We are going to need a helper function to split the dataset into batches:"

As a result, we can measure the quality of the embeddings themselves, without the influence of the ANN algorithm.



## Retrieval quality



Embeddings quality is indeed the most important factor in the semantic search quality. However, vector search engines, such as Qdrant, do not

## Wrapping up



Assessing the quality of retrieval is a critical aspect of evaluating semantic search performance. It is imperative to measure retrieval quality when aiming for optimal quality of.

Why does Qdrant deliberately exclude libraries or algorithm implementations in their benchmark comparisons?,"Qdrant excludes libraries or algorithm implementations in their benchmark comparisons because their primary focus is on vector databases.

"How does oversampling impact the performance of machine learning models, especially in the context of imbalanced datasets?","Oversampling is a technique used in machine learning to address imbalances in datasets, where one class significantly outnumbers others.

How does binary quantization work in the context of vector comparisons?,"Binary quantization is a method used in indexing and data compression, particularly by Qdrant, that involves splitting a data point's vector in half at a certain point. This process essentially divides the vector into two parts, marking everything above the split point as ""1"" and everything below as ""0"". The result is a string of bits that represents the original vector in a compressed form. This quantized code is much smaller and easier to compare. Especially for OpenAI embeddings, this type of quantization has proven to achieve a massive performance improvement at a lower cost of accuracy.","['Here, we show how the accuracy of binary quantization is quite good across different dimensions -- for both the models. \n\n\n\n## Enhanced Performance and Efficiency with Binary Quantization', ""Right, so binary quantization is actually very simple.

What is the significance of the 'always_ram' parameter in the context of vector quantization in Qdrant?,"In the context of vector quantization in Qdrant, the 'always_ram' parameter determines whether quantized vectors should be kept always cached in RAM or not.

Effectively, this means that the amount of memory required to store a vector is reduced by a factor of 4.



In addition to reducing the memory footprint, scalar quantization also speeds up the search process.

Qdrant uses a special SIMD CPU instruction to perform fast vector comparison.

```



When using `must_not`, the clause becomes `true` if none if the conditions listed inside `should` is satisfied.

In this sense, `must_not` is equivalent to the expression `(NOT A) AND (NOT B) AND (NOT C)`.



### Clauses combination



It is also possible to use several clauses simultaneously:



```http

POST /collections/{collection_name}/points/scroll

{

    ""filter"": {

        ""must"": [
[{ ""id"": 2, ""city"": ""London"", ""color"": ""red"" }]

```



When using `must`, the clause becomes `true` only if every condition listed inside `must` is satisfied.

In this sense, `must` is equivalent to the operator `AND`.



### Should



Example:



```http

POST /collections/{collection_name}/points/scroll

{

    ""filter"": {

        ""should"": [

            { ""key"": ""city"", ""match"": { ""value"": ""London"" } },

            { ""key"": ""color"", ""match"": { ""value"": ""red"" } }

        ]

    }

}

```
{ ""id"": 3, ""city"": ""London"", ""color"": ""blue"" },

  { ""id"": 4, ""city"": ""Berlin"", ""color"": ""red"" }

]

```



When using `should`, the clause becomes `true` if at least one condition listed inside `should` is satisfied.

In this sense, `should` is equivalent to the operator `OR`.



### Must Not



Example:



```http

POST /collections/{collection_name}/points/scroll

{

    ""filter"": {

        ""must_not"": [

            { ""key"": ""city"", ""match"": { ""value"": ""London"" } },

What are some advantages of vector search over keyword-based search?,"Vector search has clear advantages over keyword-based search in various scenarios as outlined in the document chunk. Some of these advantages include:

1. Multi-lingual & multi-modal search: Vector search is effective in handling searches across multiple languages and modalities.
2. For short texts with typos and ambiguous content-dependent meanings: Vector search excels in situations where the search queries are short, contain typos, or have ambiguous meanings.
3. Specialized domains with tuned encoder models: Vector search is beneficial in specialized domains where encoder models can be fine-tuned for better search results.
4. Document-as-a-Query similarity search: Vector search allows for similarity searches where the entire document can be used as a query to find similar documents.

While vector search offers these advantages, it is important to note that keyword-based search still has its relevance in certain cases. For example, in out-of-domain search.","['There is no one-size-fits-all approach that would not compromise on performance or flexibility.\n\nSo if your use case utilizes vector search in any significant way, it is worth investing in a dedicated vector search engine, aka vector database.', ""preprocessing of the documents and queries.

- 🤔 For short texts with typos and ambiguous content-dependent meanings

- 👨‍🔬 Specialized domains with tuned encoder models

- 📄 Document-as-a-Query similarity search



It doesn't mean we do not keyword search anymore. There are also some cases in which this kind of method

might be useful:

# A wrap up



Each search scenario requires a specialized tool to achieve the best results possible. Still, combining multiple tools with 

minimal overhead is possible to improve the search precision even further. Introducing vector search into an existing search 

stack doesn't need to be a revolution but just one small step at a time. 



You'll never cover all the possible queries with a list of synonyms, so a full-text search may not find all the relevant
documents. There are also some cases in which your users use different terminology than the one you have in your database. 

Those problems are easily solvable with neural vector embeddings, and combining both approaches with an additional reranking 

step is possible. So you don't need to resign from your well-known full-text search mechanism but extend it with vector 

search to support the queries you haven't foreseen.
## Next Steps



Vector search is an exciting alternative to sparse methods. It solves the issues we had with the keyword-based search without needing to maintain lots of heuristics manually. It requires an additional component, a neural encoder, to convert text into vectors.

What parameters can be configured in the configuration file to improve performance in HNSW indexing?,"In the context of HNSW indexing, the parameters that can be configured in the configuration file to enhance performance are `m`, `ef_construct`, and `ef`. 

- `m`: This parameter represents the number of edges per node in the index graph. A higher value for `m` leads to more accurate search results but also requires more space. By adjusting `m`, you can control the trade-off between search accuracy and space efficiency.

- `ef_construct`: When building the index, `ef_construct` specifies the number of neighbors to consider. Increasing the value of `ef_construct` improves the accuracy of the search but also increases the time required to build the index. 

- `ef`: This parameter is used when searching for targets. It determines the search range for finding nearest neighbors.

How does product quantization differ from scalar quantization in terms of compression and computational efficiency?,"Product quantization involves dividing data into chunks and quantizing each segment individually, approximating each chunk with a centroid index that represents the original vector component. The positions of these centroids are determined through clustering algorithms like k-means, with Qdrant currently utilizing 256 centroids, allowing each centroid index to be represented by a single byte. Product quantization can achieve higher compression factors compared to scalar quantization. However, there are tradeoffs to consider. Product quantization distance calculations are not SIMD-friendly, resulting in slower computational speed compared to scalar quantization. Additionally, product quantization introduces a loss of accuracy, making it more suitable for high-dimensional vectors.

While Qdrant offers various options to store some parts of the data on disk, starting

only a positive impact on memory but also on the performance. 



## Scalar Quantization



Scalar quantization is a data compression technique that converts floating point values
Effectively, this means that the amount of memory required to store a vector is reduced by a factor of 4.



In addition to reducing the memory footprint, scalar quantization also speeds up the search process.

Qdrant uses a special SIMD CPU instruction to perform fast vector comparison.

This instruction works with 8-bit integers, so the conversion to `uint8` allows Qdrant to perform the comparison faster.
5. RAM: Store the full vectors and payload on disk. Limit what you load from memory to the binary quantization index. This helps reduce the memory footprint and improve the overall efficiency of the system.

How can dissimilarity search be used for outlier detection in a dataset?,"Dissimilarity search can be utilized for outlier detection in a dataset by first establishing a set of reference points that are considered ""normal"". These reference points serve as a benchmark for comparison. Subsequently, the dissimilarity search algorithm is applied to identify the data points that are the most dissimilar to the reference set. These identified points are then flagged as potential outliers or anomalies in the dataset. This approach allows for the detection of abnormal data points even in cases where labels are not available, enabling the identification of outliers based on their deviation from the established ""normal"" reference points.

How does binary quantization work and what benefits does it offer in terms of query processing times and data compression?,"Binary quantization is a method used by Qdrant for fast indexing and data compression. In this process, each data point is represented as a vector. The quantization splits the vector in half at a certain point, marking everything above as ""1"" and everything below as ""0"". This results in a string of bits that represents the original vector, making it much smaller and easier to compare. By supporting vector comparisons, binary quantization can significantly speed up query processing times, up to 40 times faster. This method is especially effective for OpenAI embeddings, where it has been shown to achieve a massive performance improvement at a lower cost of accuracy.","['Here, we show how the accuracy of binary quantization is quite good across different dimensions -- for both the models. \n\n\n\n## Enhanced Performance and Efficiency with Binary Quantization', '5 Keys to Learning from the Episode:\n\n\n\n1.

What is the concept of the `best_score` strategy introduced in version 1.6.0 of the recommendation system?,"The `best_score` strategy, introduced in version 1.6.0 of the recommendation system, is based on the idea of finding similar vectors by identifying those that are closer to a positive example while avoiding those that are closer to a negative one. This strategy measures each candidate against every example and selects the best positive and best negative scores. The final score is determined using a specific formula: if the best positive score is greater than the best negative score, the final score is set as the best positive score. Otherwise, the final score is calculated as the negative of the square of the best negative score. It is important to note that the performance of the `best_score` strategy is linearly impacted by the number of examples provided.","['##### One positive and one negative example\n\n\n\n<video autoplay=""true"" loop=""true"" width=""100%"" controls><source src=""/articles_data/new-recommendation-api/one-positive-one-negative.mp4"" type=""video/mp4""></video>\n\n\n\nThe more likes and dislikes we add, the more diverse the results of the `best_score` strategy will be.

            }

        ]

  },

}

```
client

        positive_vectors: vec![vec![100.0, 231.0].into()],

        negative: vec![718.into()],

        negative_vectors: vec![vec![0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5].into()],

        strategy: Some(RecommendStrategy::AverageVector.into()),

        filter: Some(Filter::must([Condition::matches(

            ""city"",

        )])),
This is the default strategy that's going to be set implicitly, but you can explicitly define it by setting `""strategy"": ""average_vector""` in the recommendation request.



### Best score strategy



*Available as of v1.6.0*



A new strategy introduced in v1.6, is called `best_score`. It is based on the idea that the best way to find similar vectors is to find the ones that are closer to a positive example, while avoiding the ones that are closer to a negative one."
How does Qdrant handle sparse vectors and what changes have been made to accommodate them?,"Qdrant, until recently, was not able to handle sparse vectors natively. The majority of dimensions in sparse vectors are usually zeros, making them theoretically high dimensional. However, Qdrant stores sparse vectors differently by only keeping track of the non-zero dimensions. Previously, some users attempted to convert sparse vectors to dense vectors as a workaround, but this was not considered the best solution. In response to user demand for a single tool that can handle both sparse and dense vectors, Qdrant has now introduced support for sparse vectors. This change allows users to work with both sparse and dense vectors seamlessly within the Qdrant tool, eliminating the need for alternative solutions or tools for keyword lookup.","['Until now, Qdrant has not been able to handle sparse vectors natively. Some were trying to convert them to dense vectors, but that was not the best solution or a suggested way. We even wrote a piece with [our thoughts on building a hybrid search](/articles/hybrid-search/), and we encouraged you to use a different tool for keyword lookup.', 'vector: sparse_vector.data,\n\n        limit: 3,\n\n        ..Default::default()\n\n    })\n\n    .await?;\n\n```\n\n\n\n```java\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\n\n\nimport io.qdrant.client.QdrantClient;\n\nimport io.qdrant.client.QdrantGrpcClient;\n\nimport io.qdrant.client.grpc.Points.SearchPoints;\n\nimport io.qdrant.client.grpc.Points.SparseIndices;\n\n\n\nQdrantClient client =\n\n    new QdrantClient(QdrantGrpcClient.newBuilder(""localhost"", 6334, false).build());\n\n\n\nclient\n\n.searchAsync(\n\n    SearchPoints.newBuilder()', 'Check out the [sparse vectors article](../sparse-vectors/) and [sparse vectors index docs](/documentation/concepts/indexing/#sparse-vector-index) for more details on what this new index means for Qdrant users.\n\n\n\n### Discovery API', '},\n\n)\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n### 3.

### 3. Inserting Sparse Vectors



Here, we see the process of inserting a sparse vector into the Qdrant collection. This step is key to building a dataset that can be quickly retrieved in the first stage of the retrieval process, utilizing the efficiency of sparse vectors. Since this is for demonstration purposes, we insert only one point with Sparse Vector and no dense vector.



```python

client.upsert(

    collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,

    points=[
```json

{

  ""indices"": [6, 7],

  ""values"": [1.0, 2.0]

}

```



The `indices` and `values` arrays must have the same length.

And the `indices` must be unique.



If the `indices` are not sorted, Qdrant will sort them internally so you may not rely on the order of the elements.



Sparse vectors must be named and can be uploaded in the same way as dense vectors.

However, if the only information you had was that your user dislikes some items, you couldn't use it directly.



Qdrant 1.6 brings a more flexible API. You can now provide both IDs and vectors of positive and negative examples. You can even 

combine them within a single request. That makes the new implementation backward compatible, so you can easily upgrade an existing

Qdrant instance without any changes in your code. And the default behaviour of the API is still the same as before. However, we

What are the two main interfaces available for interacting with Qdrant and where can the documentation for each be found?,"The two main interfaces available for interacting with Qdrant are REST API and gRPC API. The documentation for REST API can be found in the [OpenAPI Specification](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html), while the documentation for gRPC API can be found [here](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/blob/master/docs/grpc/docs.md). The gRPC methods in Qdrant follow the same principles as REST, with each REST endpoint having a corresponding gRPC method. The gRPC interface in Qdrant is available on a specified port as outlined in the configuration file, with the default port being 6334. If choosing to use gRPC, it is necessary to expose the port when starting Qdrant, such as when running the service inside a Docker container.","['## What sets Qdrant apart?', '|![java](/docs/misc/java.webp)|**[Java](https://github.com/qdrant/java-client)**|[Available on Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.qdrant/client)|[Latest Release](https://github.com/qdrant/java-client/releases)|\n\n\n\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n\n\nAll interaction with Qdrant takes place via the REST API.

What is the purpose of the `task_type` parameter when obtaining Nomic embeddings?,"The `task_type` parameter in the `nomic-embed-text-v1` model is used to define the type of embeddings that are obtained for documents. When obtaining Nomic embeddings for documents, you need to set the `task_type` parameter to `search_document`. This ensures that the embeddings generated are specifically tailored for document search purposes. By specifying the `task_type` as `search_document`, you are instructing the model to encode the text in a way that is optimized for searching and retrieving relevant documents based on the input query. This parameter helps customize the embeddings to suit the specific requirements of document retrieval tasks within the Nomic framework.","['Once installed, you can configure it with the official Python client or through direct HTTP requests.\n\n\n\n<aside role=""status"">Using Nomic Text Embeddings requires configuring the Nomic API token</aside>\n\n\n\nYou can use Nomic embeddings directly in Qdrant client calls. There is a difference in the way the embeddings\n\nare obtained for documents and queries. The `task_type` parameter defines the embeddings that you get.\n\nFor documents, set the `task_type` to `search_document`:\n\n\n\n```python', '```python\n\noutput = embed.text(\n\n    texts=[""What is the best vector database?""],\n\n    model=""nomic-embed-text-v1"",\n\n    task_type=""search_query"",\n\n)\n\n\n\nqdrant_client.search(\n\n    collection_name=""my-collection"",\n\n    query=output[""embeddings""][0],\n\n)\n\n```\n\n\n\nFor more information, see the Nomic documentation on [Text embeddings](https://docs.nomic.ai/reference/endpoints/nomic-embed-text).', 'The Embedding Model API supports various task types, outlined as follows:\n\n\n\n1. `retrieval_query`: Specifies the given text is a query in a search/retrieval setting.\n\n2. `retrieval_document`: Specifies the given text is a document from the corpus being searched.\n\n3. `semantic_similarity`: Specifies the given text will be used for Semantic Text Similarity.\n\n4. `classification`: Specifies that the given text will be classified.\n\n5. `clustering`: Specifies that the embeddings will be used for clustering.', "".

You can use Nomic embeddings directly in Qdrant client calls. There is a difference in the way the embeddings

are obtained for documents and queries. The `task_type` parameter defines the embeddings that you get.

For documents, set the `task_type` to `search_document`:



```python
```python

output = embed.text(

    texts=[""What is the best vector database?""],

    model=""nomic-embed-text-v1"",

    task_type=""search_query"",

)



qdrant_client.search(

    collection_name=""my-collection"",

    query=output[""embeddings""][0],

)

```



For more information, see the Nomic documentation on [Text embeddings](https://docs.nomic.ai/reference/endpoints/nomic-embed-text).
The Embedding Model API supports various task types, outlined as follows:



1. `retrieval_query`: Specifies the given text is a query in a search/retrieval setting.

2. `retrieval_document`: Specifies the given text is a document from the corpus being searched.

3. `semantic_similarity`: Specifies the given text will be used for Semantic Text Similarity.

4. `classification`: Specifies that the given text will be classified.

5. `clustering`: Specifies that the embeddings will be used for clustering.

How can you use the Nomic library to upsert data into a collection and query it using text embeddings?,"To upsert data into a collection and query it using text embeddings with the Nomic library, you first need to use the `embed.text` method with the `task_type` set to `search_document` to generate embeddings for the text data you want to upsert. After obtaining the embeddings, you can use the `QdrantClient` to upsert the data into a specific collection by providing the collection name and the batch of points containing the IDs and corresponding vectors.

To query the collection, you need to set the `task_type` to `search_query` in the `embed.text` method with the query text. Once you have the query embeddings, you can use the `QdrantClient` to search the collection by providing the collection name and the query embedding to retrieve relevant results based on similarity.

By default, Qdrant tries to minimize network traffic and doesn't return vectors in search results.

But you can force Qdrant to do so by setting the `with_vector` parameter of the Search/Scroll to `true`.

It not only supports all necessary operations with vectors but also allows to store additional payload along with vectors and use it to perform filtering of the search result.

Qdrant has a client for python and also defines the API schema if you need to use it from other languages.



The easiest way to use Qdrant is to run a pre-built image.

So make sure you have Docker installed on your system.



To start Qdrant, use the instructions on its [homepage](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant)."

Qdrant exposes administration tools which enable to modify at runtime the behavior of a qdrant instance without changing its configuration manually.



## Locking



A locking API enables users to restrict the possible operations on a qdrant process.

#### What is happening in the OptimizerConfig? 



We're setting `indexing_threshold` to 0 i.e. disabling the indexing to zero. This allows faster uploads of vectors and payloads. We will turn it back on down below, once all the data is loaded
Using `memmap_threshold_kb` is not recommended in this case. It would require

the [optimizer](../../concepts/optimizer/) to constantly

transform in-memory segments into memmap segments on disk. This process is

slower, and the optimizer can be a bottleneck when ingesting a large amount of

data.

[Configuring Memmap Storage](../../concepts/storage/#configuring-memmap-storage).

## Summary"
How can Qdrant be configured to optimize throughput by utilizing multiple cores for parallel processing?,"To optimize throughput in Qdrant and utilize multiple cores for parallel processing, you can configure the system to use minimal number of segments, typically set to 2. By setting the default_segment_number to 2 in the optimizers_config section of the PUT request for creating a collection, you can instruct Qdrant to use a smaller number of segments. This approach benefits from the size of the index and reduces the overall number of vector comparisons needed to find the nearest neighbors. However, it is important to note that larger segments require more time to build the index. By adjusting this configuration parameter, you can strike a balance between maximizing throughput and optimizing the efficiency of vector search operations in Qdrant.","['Those approaches are not mutually exclusive, but in some cases it might be preferable to optimize for one or another.\n\n\n\nTo prefer minimizing latency, you can set up Qdrant to use as many cores as possible for a single request\\.\n\nYou can do this by setting the number of segments in the collection to be equal to the number of cores in the system.

How can one enable distributed deployment mode in Qdrant?,"To enable distributed deployment mode in Qdrant, one needs to enable the cluster mode in the configuration or set the ENV variable `QDRANT__CLUSTER__ENABLED=true`.

# Distributed deployment



Since version v0.8.0 Qdrant supports a distributed deployment mode.

In this mode, multiple Qdrant services communicate with each other to distribute the data across the peers to extend the storage capabilities and increase stability.
. This is called [custom sharding](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/distributed_deployment/#user-defined-sharding).
In addition, you have to make sure:



* To use a performant [persistent storage](#storage) for your data

* To configure the [security settings](/documentation/guides/security/) for your deployment

* To set up and configure Qdrant on multiple nodes for a highly available [distributed deployment](/documentation/guides/distributed_deployment/)

* To set up a load balancer for your Qdrant cluster

* To create a [backup and disaster recovery strategy](/documentation/concepts/snapshots/) for your data"
What is the recommended approach for determining the number of shards when creating a collection using Qdrant?,"When creating a collection using Qdrant, it is recommended to set the number of shards to be a multiple of the number of nodes currently running in your cluster. For example, if you have 3 nodes in your cluster, setting the number of shards to 6 could be a good option. Shards are evenly distributed across all existing nodes when a collection is first created. It is important to note that Qdrant does not automatically rebalance shards if your cluster size or replication factor changes, as this operation can be expensive on large clusters.

## Parallel upload into multiple shards



In Qdrant, each collection is split into shards. Each shard has a separate Write-Ahead-Log (WAL), which is responsible for ordering operations.

By creating multiple shards, you can parallelize upload of a large dataset. From 2 to 4 shards per one machine is a reasonable number.

```python
Each node knows where all parts of the collection are stored through the [consensus protocol](./#raft), so when you send a search request to one Qdrant node, it automatically queries all other nodes to obtain the full search result.



When you create a collection, Qdrant splits the collection into `shard_number` shards. If left unset, `shard_number` is set to the number of nodes in your cluster:

How is the discovery score computed in the context provided?,"In the context provided, the discovery score is computed using the formula: 

Discovery Score = sigmoid(s(v_t)) + Σ rank(v_i^+, v_i^-)

$$

\text{rank}(v^+, v^-) = \begin{cases}

    1, &\quad s(v^+) \geq s(v^-) \\\\

    -1, &\quad s(v^+) < s(v^-)

\end{cases}

$$

where $v^+$ represents a positive example, $v^-$ represents a negative example, and $s(v)$ is the similarity score of a vector $v$ to the target vector. The discovery score is then computed as:

$$

 \text{discovery score} = \text{sigmoid}(s(v_t))+ \sum \text{rank}(v_i^+, v_i^-),

$$
The interface for providing context is similar to the recommendation API (ids or raw vectors). Still, in this case, they need to be provided in the form of positive-negative pairs.



Discovery API lets you do two new types of search:

- **Discovery search**: Uses the context (the pairs of positive-negative vectors) and a target to return the points more similar to the target, but constrained by the context.

How does Qdrant optimize storage at the segment level?,"Qdrant optimizes storage at the segment level by applying changes in batches rather than individually. When optimization is needed, the segment to be optimized remains readable during the rebuild process. This is achieved by wrapping the segment into a proxy that handles data changes transparently. Changed data is placed in a copy-on-write segment, prioritizing retrieval and subsequent updates. This approach ensures efficiency in storage optimization within Qdrant.","['Qdrant’s storage efficiency delivers cost savings on hardware while ensuring a responsive system even with extensive data sets.

In an independent benchmark stress test, Pienso discovered that Qdrant could efficiently store 128 million documents, consuming a mere 20.4GB of storage and only 1.25GB of memory
Effectively, this means that the amount of memory required to store a vector is reduced by a factor of 4.



In addition to reducing the memory footprint, scalar quantization also speeds up the search process.

Qdrant uses a special SIMD CPU instruction to perform fast vector comparison.

This instruction works with 8-bit integers, so the conversion to `uint8` allows Qdrant to perform the comparison faster.
led to some modest overhead in case of disk latency. The kernel may

stop a user thread trying to access a mapped region, which incurs some context

[scalar](https://qdrant.tech/articles/scalar-quantization/) or 

[product](https://qdrant.tech/articles/product-quantization/)-based).
The service may require the creation of temporary segments.

Such segments, for example, are created as copy-on-write segments during optimization itself.



It is also essential to have at least one small segment that Qdrant will use to store frequently updated data.

On the other hand, too many small segments lead to suboptimal search performance.

What is the purpose of the Vacuum Optimizer in the Qdrant database system?,"The Vacuum Optimizer in the Qdrant database system is utilized to address the issue of accumulated deleted records within segments.

The Vacuum Optimizer is triggered when a segment has accumulated a significant number of deleted records, as defined by the criteria set in the configuration file. This optimizer helps in optimizing segments by removing these accumulated deleted records, thereby improving system performance and efficiency. The configuration file specifies parameters such as the minimal fraction of deleted vectors and the minimal number of vectors in a segment required to trigger the Vacuum Optimizer. By running the Vacuum Optimizer, the system can effectively manage and optimize segments to prevent performance degradation due to accumulated deleted records.","[""Systems like Qdrant exemplify scalability in vector databases.

# Optimizer



It is much more efficient to apply changes in batches than perform each change individually, as many other databases do. Qdrant here is no exception. Since Qdrant operates with data structures that are not always easy to change, it is sometimes necessary to rebuild those structures completely.



Storage optimization in Qdrant occurs at the segment level (see [storage](../storage)).
So instead of this one, we had a real time inference endpoint which basically limited us to some number of requests that we had preset earlier while deploying the model. So this was one of the bottlenecks and then lambda function was always there, I think this one and also I think in place of this Qdrant vector database, as I mentioned, we had Postgres. So yeah, that was also a limitation because it used to use a lot of compute capacity within the EC two instance as compared to Qdrant
Like many other databases, Qdrant does not delete entries immediately after a query.

Instead, it marks records as deleted and ignores them for future queries.



This strategy allows us to minimize disk access - one of the slowest operations.

However, a side effect of this strategy is that, over time, deleted records accumulate, occupy memory and slow down the system.



To avoid these adverse effects, Vacuum Optimizer is used.

It is used if the segment has accumulated too many deleted records."
What is the purpose of the `payload` field in the data points?,"The `payload` field in the data points being upserted using the QdrantClient serves as a container for additional metadata or information related to the vector data being stored.

This metadata can be used for filtering, searching, or categorizing the vectors during retrieval or query operations, enabling more efficient and targeted data analysis and retrieval processes. In the examples given, the `payload` field includes information like city names, prices, and other relevant details specific to each data point, enhancing the overall utility and relevance of the stored vector data.","['```http\n\nPOST /collections/{collection_name}/points/payload\n\n{\n\n    ""payload"": {\n\n        ""property1"": ""string"",\n\n        ""property2"": ""string""\n\n    },\n\n    ""filter"": {\n\n        ""must"": [\n\n            {\n\n                ""key"": ""color"",\n\n                ""match"": {\n\n                    ""value"": ""red""\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        ]\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n\n```python\n\nclient.set_payload(\n\n    collection_name=""{collection_name}"",\n\n    payload={\n\n        ""property1"": ""string"",', '{\n\n                        ""id"": 1,\n\n                        ""vector"": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0],\n\n                        ""payload"": {}\n\n                    }\n\n                ]\n\n            }\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n            ""update_vectors"": {\n\n                ""points"": [\n\n                    {\n\n                        ""id"": 1,\n\n                        ""vector"": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]\n\n                    }\n\n                ]\n\n            }\n\n        },\n\n        {', '""with_payload"": [""title"", ""text""],\n\n\n\n        // Options for specifying what to bring from the vector(s) \n\n        // of the looked up point, true by default\n\n        ""with_vectors: false\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n\n```python\n\nclient.search_groups(\n\n    collection_name=""chunks"",\n\n    # Same as in the regular search() API\n\n    query_vector=[1.1],\n\n    # Grouping parameters\n\n    group_by=""document_id"",  # Path of the field to group by\n\n    limit=2,  # Max amount of groups', '""test_payload_2"": ""2"",\n\n                    ""test_payload_3"": ""3""\n\n                },\n\n                ""points"": [1]\n\n            }\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n            ""delete_payload"": {\n\n                ""keys"": [""test_payload_2""],\n\n                ""points"": [1]\n\n            }\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n            ""clear_payload"": {\n\n                ""points"": [1]\n\n            }\n\n        },\n\n        {""delete"": {""points"": [1]}}\n\n    ]\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n\n```python\n\nclient.batch_update_points(', 'and\n\n\n\n```http\n\nPUT /collections/{collection_name}/points\n\n{\n\n    ""points"": [\n\n        {\n\n            ""id"": 1,\n\n            ""payload"": {""color"": ""red""},\n\n            ""vector"": [0.9, 0.1, 0.1]\n\n        }\n\n    ]\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n\n```python\n\nclient.upsert(\n\n    collection_name=""{collection_name}"",\n\n    points=[\n\n        models.PointStruct(\n\n            id=1,\n\n            payload={\n\n                ""color"": ""red"",\n\n            },\n\n            vector=[0.9, 0.1, 0.1],\n\n        ),\n\n    ],\n\n)\n\n```\n\n\n\n```typescript']","```http

Regardless of the method used, Qdrant will extract the shard data from the snapshot and properly register shards in the cluster.

If there are other active replicas of the recovered shards in the cluster, Qdrant will replicate them to the newly recovered node by default to maintain data consistency.



### Recover from a URL or local file



*Available as of v0.11.3*
Since a replication factor of ""2"" would require twice as much storage space, it is advised to make sure the hardware can host the additional shard replicas beforehand.



### Creating new shard replicas



It is possible to create or delete replicas manually on an existing collection using the [Update collection cluster setup API](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html?v=v0.11.0#tag/cluster/operation/update_collection_cluster)."

How does Qdrant address the limitations faced by the HNSW index when dealing with cases in the middle of weak and stringent filters?,"Qdrant addresses the limitations faced by the HNSW index when dealing with cases in the middle of weak and stringent filters by extending the HNSW graph with additional edges based on the stored payload values. This extension allows for more efficient searching of nearby vectors using the HNSW index while applying filters during the search in the graph. By adding extra edges, Qdrant minimizes the overhead on condition checks since the conditions only need to be calculated for a small fraction of the points involved in the search.

How is metric learning utilized in addressing the challenge of detecting anomalies in coffee beans?,"Metric learning is utilized in addressing the challenge of detecting anomalies in coffee beans by encoding images in an n-dimensional vector space and using learned similarities to label images during the inference process.

* The second step is finetuning. Its purpose is to train the model to distinguish the required types of anomalies.

What is the purpose of the `ordering` parameter in Qdrant and when should it be used?,"The `ordering` parameter in Qdrant is used with update and delete operations to ensure that the operations are executed in the same order on all replicas. When this option is enabled, Qdrant will route the operation to the leader replica of the shard and wait for the response before responding to the client. This is beneficial in preventing data inconsistency that may arise from concurrent updates of the same documents. The `ordering` parameter is particularly recommended when read operations are more frequent than updates and when search performance is critical. By enforcing a specific order of operations across replicas, the `ordering` parameter helps maintain data consistency and integrity in distributed environments.","['## What sets Qdrant apart?', ""Those familiar with the Qdrant API will notice that the extra care taken to be consistent with the existing named vectors API -- this is to make it easier to use sparse vectors in existing codebases.

How can you enable API key based authentication in Qdrant instances for security purposes?,"To enable API key based authentication in Qdrant instances for security purposes, you must specify a key in the configuration. This can be done by adding the following code snippet to your configuration file:

```yaml
service:
  # Set an api-key.
  # If set, all requests must include a header with the api-key.
  # example header: `api-key: <API-KEY>`
  #
  # If you enable this you should also enable TLS.
  # (Either above or via an external service like nginx.)
  # Sending an api-key over an unencrypted channel is insecure.
  api_key: your_secret_api_key_here
```

By adding this configuration, all requests to your Qdrant instance must include a header with the specified API key. This simple form of client authentication helps secure your instance and is available starting from version 1.2.0","['This can be used to secure your instance.\n\n\n\nTo enable API key based authentication in your own Qdrant instance you must\n\nspecify a key in the configuration:\n\n\n\n```yaml\n\nservice:\n\n  # Set an api-key.\n\n  # If set, all requests must include a header with the api-key.\n\n  # example header: `api-key: <API-KEY>`\n\n  #\n\n  # If you enable this you should also enable TLS.\n\n  # (Either above or via an external service like nginx.)\n\n  # Sending an api-key over an unencrypted channel is insecure.', '```\n\n> **Note:** The API key needs to be present in the request header every time you make a request via Rest or gRPC interface.\n\n\n\n## Step 3: Authenticate via SDK\n\n\n\nNow that you have created your first cluster and key, you might want to access Qdrant Cloud from within your application.\n\nOur official Qdrant clients for Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and .NET all support the API key parameter. \n\n\n\n```python\n\nfrom qdrant_client import QdrantClient\n\n\n\nqdrant_client = QdrantClient(', 'api_key: your_secret_api_key_here\n\n```\n\n\n\nOr alternatively, you can use the environment variable:\n\n\n\n```bash\n\nexport QDRANT__SERVICE__API_KEY=your_secret_api_key_here\n\n```\n\n\n\n<aside role=""alert""><a href=""#tls"">TLS</a> must be used to prevent leaking the API key over an unencrypted connection.</aside>\n\n\n\nFor using API key based authentication in Qdrant cloud see the cloud\n\n[Authentication](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/authentication)\n\nsection.', 'The transition is even easier if you use the official client libraries.

> **Note:** The API key needs to be present in the request header every time you make a request via Rest or gRPC interface.



## Step 3: Authenticate via SDK



Now that you have created your first cluster and key, you might want to access Qdrant Cloud from within your application.

Our official Qdrant clients for Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and .NET all support the API key parameter. 



```python

from qdrant_client import QdrantClient



qdrant_client = QdrantClient(
api_key: your_secret_api_key_here

```



Or alternatively, you can use the environment variable:



```bash

export QDRANT__SERVICE__API_KEY=your_secret_api_key_here

```



<aside role=""alert""><a href=""#tls"">TLS</a> must be used to prevent leaking the API key over an unencrypted connection.</aside>



For using API key based authentication in Qdrant cloud see the cloud

[Authentication](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/authentication)

section.
The transition is even easier if you use the official client libraries. For example, the [Python Client](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-client) has the support of the API key already built-in, so you only need to provide it once, when the QdrantClient instance is created.



### Cluster configuration
